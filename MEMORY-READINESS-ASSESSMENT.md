## Layer-by-Layer Assessment

### LAYER 1: PERSISTENT STORAGE [CRITICAL]

**Score: 2.5/10**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 PostgreSQL `events` table | ✅ DONE | Healthy, 3638 events |
| 1.2 `group_id` CHECK constraint | ❌ MISSING | No `^allura-` prefix validation |
| 1.3 GIN index on `metadata` | 🟡 PARTIAL | Composite index exists, GIN missing |
| 1.4 `proposals` table | ❌ MISSING | Required for SOC2 curator queue |
| 1.5 Connection pooling | ❌ MISSING | No pooling/retry logic |
| 1.6 Neo4j Memory schema | ❌ MISSING | Database empty, no nodes |

---

### LAYER 3: RETRIEVAL PIPELINE [CRITICAL]

**Score: 0/10**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 Federated search | ❌ MISSING | No PostgreSQL + Neo4j merge |
| 3.2 PostgreSQL search filters | ❌ MISSING | No search implementation |

| 3.8 Deduplication check | ❌ MISSING | No MERGE guard |
| 3.9 Search timeout | ❌ MISSING | No timeout logic |
| 3.10 Pagination | ❌ MISSING | No pagination |

**Critical Gap:** No retrieval pipeline exists. The system cannot search across PostgreSQL and Neo4j in parallel.

---

### LAYER 4: AGENT ACCESS & ORCHESTRATION HOOKS [CRITICAL]

**Score: 1/10**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 Brooks reads memory | ❌ MISSING | No tool calls in agent definition |
| 4.2 Brooks writes memory | ❌ MISSING | No AER event logging |

| 4.10 Session hooks | ❌ MISSING | No session-start/end hooks |

**Critical Gap:** Agents exist but have no memory integration. Brooks mentions memory in his definition but has no tool calls. Scout is purely reconnaissance, not memory-aware.

---

### LAYER 5: PROMOTION & GOVERNANCE [CRITICAL]

**Score: 0/10**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 5.1 SOC2 mode routing | ❌ MISSING | No proposals table |

| 5.9 Neo4j write limit | ❌ MISSING | No limits |
| 5.10 Batch aggregation | ❌ MISSING | No batch logic |

**Critical Gap:** Zero governance layer. No promotion mechanism, no curator workflow, no versioning.

---

### LAYER 6: NAMESPACE & TENANT ISOLATION [CRITICAL]

**Score: 1/10**

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 6.1 `group_id` required | 🟡 PARTIAL | Column exists, not enforced |

---

## Priority Actions

### PRIORITY 1 — HARD BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Any GO)

| # | Action | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 1.1 | Implement all 5 memory tools (`memory_add`, `memory_search`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_delete`) with Zod validation | Agents cannot interact with memory system without tools |
| 1.2 | Create Neo4j Memory schema: `Memory` nodes, `SUPERSEDES` relationships, `deprecated` flag, indexes | Knowledge graph layer is completely missing |
| 1.3 | Build MCP server to expose memory tools via stdio transport | Tools must be callable from OpenCode/Claude/Cursor |
| 1.4 | Add CHECK constraint: `group_id ~ '^allura-'` to enforce tenant isolation | Cross-tenant data leakage is a security risk |
| 1.5 | Create `proposals` table for SOC2 curator queue | Governance layer requires approval workflow |
| 1.6 | Implement federated search: PostgreSQL full-text + Neo4j semantic merge | Retrieval pipeline is core functionality |
| 1.7 | Add agent hooks: session-start read, session-end write, AER event logging | Agents must automatically read/write memory |
| 1.8 | Create `npm run start` script with auto-migration | One-command startup is a hard requirement |
| 1.9 | Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with smoke tests | CI pipeline is required for reliability |

### PRIORITY 2 — CRITICAL GAPS (Fix Before First Production Workload)

| # | Action | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 2.1 | Implement promotion governance: SOC2/auto modes, curator dashboard, versioning | High-value insights need promotion path |
| 2.2 | Add observability: structured logging, metrics, traceability | Production systems require monitoring |
| 2.3 | Build health check endpoint: `GET /health` returning `{ status: "ok" }` | Runtime monitoring requires health checks |
| 2.4 | Create `.env.example` documenting all DB credentials and config vars | New developers need setup guide |
| 2.5 | Implement connection pooling for PostgreSQL and Neo4j clients | Production workloads require pooling |

### PRIORITY 3 — RECOMMENDED (Fix Within One Sprint of GO)

| # | Action | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 3.1 | Add GIN index on JSONB `metadata` column | Optimize search performance |
| 3.2 | Implement circuit breaker (fail-open or fail-closed) | Prevent cascade failures |
| 3.3 | Add content size limit (10KB max) with chunking strategy | Prevent memory bloat |
| 3.4 | Create TTL policy for episodic events | Memory hygiene |
| 3.5 | Build metrics dashboard: write latency, search latency, promotion rate | Operational visibility |

### PRIORITY 4 — POLISH (Fix Before Scaling Beyond 3 Agents)

| # | Action | Rationale |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 4.1 | Optimize parallel queries for non-blocking execution | Scale performance |
| 4.2 | Add configurable `DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD` constant | Fine-tune deduplication |
| 4.3 | Implement batch aggregation for session checkpoints | Reduce Neo4j write spam |
| 4.4 | Create comprehensive integration tests | Ensure reliability at scale |
| 4.5 | Document memory system architecture in SOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md | Team onboarding |

## Architectural Principles Violated

### 1. Conceptual Integrity

**Violation:** The system has a database but no tools to access it. The architecture is incomplete — the storage layer exists, but the access layer, governance layer, and integration layer are missing.

**Brooksian Principle:** *"The most important consideration in system design is conceptual integrity. A system is best designed by a single architect or a small group working together."*

**Fix:** Design the complete memory system architecture before implementation. Define all layers: storage, access, retrieval, governance, integration.

### 2. Separation of Architecture from Implementation

**Violation:** The Blueprint describes a memory system, but the implementation is missing. Architecture and implementation are out of sync.

**Brooksian Principle:** *"Architecture defines what; implementation defines how."*

**Fix:** Update documentation to reflect current state. Add architectural decisions for memory system. Ensure implementation matches architecture.

### 3. Plan to Throw One Away

**Violation:** The current events table may not support the memory system requirements. We may need to redesign the schema.

**Brooksian Principle:** *"Plan to throw one away; you will anyway."*

**Fix:** Accept that the current schema may need revision. Design for iteration.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for memory system design
2. **This Week:** Implement PRIORITY 1 hard blockers
3. **Next Sprint:** Complete PRIORITY 2 critical gaps
4. **Before GO:** Re-run this audit to verify all blockers resolved
