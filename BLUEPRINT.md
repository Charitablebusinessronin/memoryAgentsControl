The OpenAgentsControl Harness is a deterministic multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to execute software development tasks with minimal hesitation, clear routing, and continuous learning. It operates in two modes: DAY_BUILD (interactive with approval gates) and NIGHT_BUILD (no-brakes deterministic execution).

## 1) Core Concepts

### Agent

An Agent is a specialized AI persona with defined authority, allowed tools, and handoff rules. Agents are invoked by the routing policy based on task type and performance history.

**States:** `idle | active | blocked | completed | failed`

**Key fields:**
- `agent_id` — Unique identifier (e.g., `scout_recon`, `woz_builder`)
- `role` — Functional role (e.g., "Discovery", "Implementation", "Architecture")
- `authority` — Decision-making scope
- `allowed_tools` — Tools this agent may invoke
- `handoff_rules` — Conditions for delegating to other agents

### Task

A Task is a unit of work submitted to the harness. It has a goal, acceptance criteria, and a lifecycle from submission to completion.

**States:** `pending | planning | executing | validating | completed | failed | blocked`

**Key fields:**
- `task_id` — Unique identifier
- `goal` — Plain-language description of what must be achieved
- `acceptance_criteria` — Testable conditions for completion
- `mode` — `DAY_BUILD` or `NIGHT_BUILD`
- `status` — Current state
- `assigned_agent` — Agent currently responsible

### Performance Log

The Performance Log is a structured record of agent invocations, task completions, and failures. It drives deterministic routing decisions and continuous improvement.

**Key fields:**
- `event_type` — Type of event (e.g., `AGENT_INVOKED`, `TASK_COMPLETE`)
- `agent_id` — Agent responsible
- `status` — Outcome
- `metadata` — Additional context (duration, errors, etc.)

### Routing Policy

The Routing Policy is a deterministic rule set that selects the best agent for a given task type based on performance history and role constraints.

**Key fields:**
- `task_type` — Category of work (e.g., "Discovery", "Implementation")
- `primary_agent` — First-choice agent
- `fallback_agent` — Backup agent if primary fails
- `condition` — When to apply this route

## 3) Architecture

### Components

**SCOUT_RECON** — Discovery agent responsible for producing Scout Reports (paths, entrypoints, mismatches, risks). Invoked first in every run loop.

**JOBS_INTENT_GATE** — Intent and scope agent responsible for producing Intent Briefs and Acceptance Criteria. Blocks execution until signed.

**BROOKS_ARCHITECT** — Architecture agent responsible for contracts, ADRs, and final routing policy. Final sign-off on architectural decisions.

**WOZ_BUILDER** — Implementation agent responsible for executing fixes and features. Primary builder.

**PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW** — Interface gate agent responsible for rejecting unnecessary surface area. Ensures simplicity.

**FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE** — Refactor gate agent responsible for preventing debt accumulation. Ensures maintainability.

**BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF** — Performance and diagnostics agent responsible for measurement-first optimization. Invoked only when perf/low-level constraints apply.

**Performance Log (Postgres)** — Structured event storage accessed via MCP_DOCKER tools.

**Routing Policy Engine** — Deterministic rule engine that selects agents based on task type and performance history.

## 6) Execution Rules

### Ordering

1. **SCOUT_RECON** MUST run first to produce Scout Report
2. **JOBS_INTENT_GATE** MUST run second to produce Intent Brief + Acceptance Criteria
3. **BROOKS_ARCHITECT** MUST run third to produce Contracts/ADRs and select route
4. **WOZ_BUILDER** MUST run fourth to implement step-by-step with validations
5. **PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW** MUST run fifth to reject unnecessary surface area
6. **FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE** MUST run sixth to prevent debt accumulation
7. **BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF** MUST run only if perf/low-level constraints apply

### Eligibility

- A task is eligible for execution if:
  - Goal is defined
  - Acceptance criteria are testable
  - Mode is specified (DAY_BUILD or NIGHT_BUILD)
  - No hard blockers exist

### Failure Semantics

- If primary agent fails → log `AGENT_FAILED` → try fallback agent
- If no fallback → escalate to BROOKS_ARCHITECT
- If BROOKS_ARCHITECT fails → log `BLOCKER_HIT` → stop (hard blocker)

### Retry

- In NIGHT_BUILD mode: automatic retry with fallback agent
- In DAY_BUILD mode: stop and request user approval

### Cancellation

- User can cancel task at any time
- System logs `TASK_FAILED` with cancellation reason

---

## 7) Global Constraints

### Determinism

- Routing policy MUST choose ONE best route based on Performance Log + role constraints
- Multiple approaches MUST NOT be proposed unless:
  - Performance evidence is inconclusive, OR
  - Architecture is ambiguous, OR
  - Destructive decision is required

### Documentation Compliance

- All agents MUST load AI-GUIDELINES.md as required context
- All agents MUST produce documentation artifacts following AI-GUIDELINES.md templates
- DoD MUST include documentation completeness validation

### Performance Logging

- Every agent invocation MUST log `AGENT_INVOKED` + `AGENT_COMPLETED` or `AGENT_FAILED`
- Every task MUST log `TASK_START` + `TASK_COMPLETE` or `TASK_FAILED`
- Fallbacks MUST log `FALLBACK_TRIGGERED`
- Blockers MUST log `BLOCKER_HIT`

### Role Boundaries

- Agents MUST NOT invoke tools outside their `allowed_tools` list
- Agents MUST NOT exceed their `authority` scope
- Agents MUST follow `handoff_rules` for delegation

---

## 9) Logging & Audit

### What is Persisted

- All agent invocations (`AGENT_INVOKED`, `AGENT_COMPLETED`, `AGENT_FAILED`)
- All task lifecycle events (`TASK_START`, `TASK_COMPLETE`, `TASK_FAILED`)
- All routing decisions (`FALLBACK_TRIGGERED`, `BLOCKER_HIT`)
- All approval requests (`APPROVAL_REQUESTED`, `APPROVAL_GRANTED`, `APPROVAL_DENIED`)

### What is Redacted

- No sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in metadata
- No PII in log entries

### How it is Surfaced

- Queryable via Postgres (MCP_DOCKER tools)
- Exportable for analytics (benchmark dashboards)

---

## 10) Admin Workflow

### Adding a New Agent

1. Define agent in `.opencode/agent/core/` or `.opencode/agent/subagents/`
2. Add agent metadata to `.opencode/config/agent-metadata.json`
3. Define routing policy entry in `DESIGN-ROUTING.md`
4. Update `REQUIREMENTS-MATRIX.md` with new agent responsibilities

### Updating Routing Policy

1. Modify routing table in `DESIGN-ROUTING.md`
2. Update `RISKS-AND-DECISIONS.md` with rationale
3. Validate via benchmark tests

### Changing Performance Log Schema

1. Create migration in `.opencode/migrations/`
2. Update `DATA-DICTIONARY.md` with new fields
3. Update `DESIGN-LOGGING.md` with new event types

---

| Event Type | Producer | Consumer | Purpose |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|
| `TASK_START` | Routing Policy Engine | Performance Log | Mark task beginning |
