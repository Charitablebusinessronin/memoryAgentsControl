This document describes how the OpenAgentsControl Harness is structured from a topological perspective — who calls what, how external actors interface with the system, and how architectural decisions shape interaction patterns. It complements the Blueprint's data-and-API view with a system-of-systems view.

## 1. Architectural Positioning

The OpenAgentsControl Harness is a **control plane** for multi-agent orchestration. It does not hold business logic itself — it coordinates specialized AI agents that execute software development tasks. The authoritative source of truth it maintains is the **Performance Log**, which drives deterministic routing decisions.

| Consumer Class | Interaction Mode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Developer | Sync REST | Submits tasks via CLI or API, receives results synchronously |
| CI/CD Pipeline | Sync REST | Submits tasks in NIGHT_BUILD mode, expects deterministic execution |
| Agent | Async event | Invoked by routing policy, logs events to Performance Log |
| Analytics Dashboard | Sync REST | Queries Performance Log for benchmark metrics |

## 3. Logical Topologies

### 3.1 Task Submission Topology

This topology covers how developers and CI/CD pipelines submit tasks to the harness.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev as Developer/CI
    participant API as REST API
    participant Router as Routing Policy Engine
    participant Log as Performance Log

    Dev->>API: POST /v1/tasks (goal, acceptance_criteria, mode)
    API->>Log: TASK_START
    API->>Router: Route Task
    Router->>Log: Query Performance History
    Log-->>Router: Return Metrics
    Router->>Router: Select Best Agent
    Router-->>API: Return task_id + assigned_agent
    API-->>Dev: 201 Created (task_id, status=pending)
```

**Key constraints:**
- Task MUST have goal, acceptance_criteria, and mode defined
- Task MUST be logged as `TASK_START` before routing
- Routing decision MUST be based on Performance Log history

---

### 3.2 Agent Execution Topology

This topology covers how agents are invoked, execute, and log events.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Router as Routing Policy Engine
    participant Agent as Specialized Agent
    participant Log as Performance Log
    participant Tools as Allowed Tools

    Router->>Log: AGENT_INVOKED (agent_id, task_id)
    Router->>Agent: Invoke Agent (goal, context)
    Agent->>Tools: Use Allowed Tools
    Tools-->>Agent: Return Results
    Agent->>Agent: Validate Results
    alt Success
        Agent->>Log: AGENT_COMPLETED (agent_id, task_id, status=success)
        Agent-->>Router: Return Result
    else Failure
        Agent->>Log: AGENT_FAILED (agent_id, task_id, error)
        Router->>Router: Check Fallback Policy
        alt Fallback Exists
            Router->>Log: FALLBACK_TRIGGERED
            Router->>Agent: Invoke Fallback Agent
        else No Fallback
            Router->>Log: BLOCKER_HIT
            Router-->>Router: Stop Execution
        end
    end
```

**Key constraints:**
- Agent MUST log `AGENT_INVOKED` before execution
- Agent MUST log `AGENT_COMPLETED` or `AGENT_FAILED` after execution
- Agent MUST NOT use tools outside `allowed_tools` list
- Router MUST check fallback policy on failure

---

### 3.3 Performance Logging Topology

This topology covers how events are persisted and queried for analytics.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Specialized Agent
    participant Log as Performance Log (Postgres)
    participant Analytics as Analytics Dashboard

    Agent->>Log: INSERT INTO events (event_type, agent_id, status, metadata)
    Log-->>Agent: Confirm Insert
    Analytics->>Log: SELECT * FROM events WHERE agent_id = ? AND created_at > ?
    Log-->>Analytics: Return Rows
    Analytics->>Analytics: Calculate Benchmarks
```

**Key constraints:**
- All events MUST be persisted to Postgres via MCP_DOCKER tools
- Events MUST include `event_type`, `agent_id`, `group_id`, `status`, `metadata`
- Query interface MUST support filtering by agent, event type, and date range

---

### 3.4 Documentation Validation Topology

This topology covers how documentation compliance is validated as part of DoD.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Specialized Agent
    participant Validator as Documentation Validator
    participant Log as Performance Log

    Agent->>Agent: Complete Task
    Agent->>Validator: Validate Documentation Artifacts
    Validator->>Validator: Check BLUEPRINT.md exists
    Validator->>Validator: Check SOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE.md exists
    Validator->>Validator: Check DESIGN-*.md files exist
    Validator->>Validator: Check REQUIREMENTS-MATRIX.md exists
    Validator->>Validator: Check RISKS-AND-DECISIONS.md exists
    Validator->>Validator: Check DATA-DICTIONARY.md exists
    alt All Artifacts Present
        Validator-->>Agent: Validation Passed
        Agent->>Log: TASK_COMPLETE
    else Missing Artifacts
        Validator-->>Agent: Validation Failed (missing artifacts)
        Agent->>Log: TASK_FAILED (reason=missing_documentation)
    end
```

**Key constraints:**
- Documentation validation MUST run before `TASK_COMPLETE` is logged
- All required artifacts (per AI-GUIDELINES.md) MUST be present
- Missing artifacts MUST result in `TASK_FAILED`

## 5. Risk-Architecture Traceability

| Topology | AD/RK Entry | How Architecture Addresses Risk |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Task Submission | AD-01: Deterministic Routing Policy | Ensures consistent agent selection based on performance history |
| Agent Execution | RK-01: Agent Failure | Fallback routing policy mitigates single-agent failures |
| Performance Logging | AD-02: Structured Event Schema | Enables queryable metrics for continuous improvement |
| Documentation Validation | AD-03: Documentation Compliance Gate | Prevents incomplete documentation from being marked complete |

---

## 6. Key Architectural Constraints

1. **MUST use MCP_DOCKER tools for all Postgres operations** — No direct database access
2. **MUST log all agent invocations** — No silent execution
3. **MUST validate documentation before task completion** — No incomplete artifacts
4. **MUST follow deterministic routing policy** — No ad-hoc agent selection
5. **MUST enforce role boundaries** — Agents cannot exceed authority scope
6. **MUST stop on hard blockers** — No automatic recovery from destructive changes
