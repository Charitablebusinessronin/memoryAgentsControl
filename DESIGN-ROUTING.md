## Overview

The Routing Policy Engine is the decision-making core of the OpenAgentsControl Harness. It selects the best agent for a given task type based on:

1. **Task type** — Category of work (Discovery, Architecture, Implementation, etc.)
2. **Performance history** — Success rate, average duration, fallback frequency
3. **Role constraints** — Agent authority, allowed tools, handoff rules

The routing policy is **deterministic** — given the same task type and performance history, it will always select the same agent. This enables measurable performance and continuous improvement.

## Functional Requirements

| # | Requirement | Satisfied by |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| [F2](BLUEPRINT.md#f2) | The system MUST route tasks to the appropriate agent based on task type and routing policy | Routing Table §[Routing Table](#routing-table) |
| [F5](BLUEPRINT.md#f5) | The system MUST invoke agents according to the routing policy | Routing Table §[Routing Table](#routing-table) |
| [F6](BLUEPRINT.md#f6) | The system MUST enforce agent authority boundaries (allowed tools, handoff rules) | Role Constraints §[Important Constraints](#important-constraints) |
| [F8](BLUEPRINT.md#f8) | The system MUST support fallback routing when primary agent fails | Fallback Logic §[Fallback Logic](#fallback-logic) |

---

## Routing Table

The routing table defines the primary agent, fallback agent, and condition for each task type.

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Fallback Agent | Condition |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Discovery | SCOUT_RECON | None | Always |
| Intent/Scope | JOBS_INTENT_GATE | None | Always |
| Architecture | BROOKS_ARCHITECT | None | Always |
| Implementation | WOZ_BUILDER | PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW (if interface added) | Always |
| Refactor | FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE | None | Always |
| Performance | BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF | None | Only if perf constraint |
| Validation | PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW | FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE | Always |

### Routing Rules

1. **Discovery tasks** — ALWAYS route to SCOUT_RECON first
2. **Intent/Scope tasks** — ALWAYS route to JOBS_INTENT_GATE first
3. **Architecture tasks** — ALWAYS route to BROOKS_ARCHITECT first
4. **Implementation tasks** — Route to WOZ_BUILDER, then PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW if interface added
5. **Refactor tasks** — ALWAYS route to FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE
6. **Performance tasks** — Route to BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF only if performance constraint exists
7. **Validation tasks** — Route to PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW, then FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE if needed

---

## Fallback Logic

When the primary agent fails, the Routing Policy Engine checks for a fallback agent.

### Fallback Algorithm

```
function selectFallbackAgent(taskType, primaryAgent, error):
    fallbackAgent = routingTable[taskType].fallbackAgent
    
    if fallbackAgent is None:
        log BLOCKER_HIT (reason="No fallback agent for task type")
        return BROOKS_ARCHITECT  // Escalate to architect
    
    if error is "Agent exceeded authority":
        log BLOCKER_HIT (reason="Authority violation")
        return BROOKS_ARCHITECT  // Escalate to architect
    
    if error is "Agent failed validation":
        log FALLBACK_TRIGGERED (from=primaryAgent, to=fallbackAgent)
        return fallbackAgent
    
    return fallbackAgent
```

### Fallback Scenarios

| Scenario | Primary Agent | Error | Fallback Agent | Outcome |
|----------|---------------|-------|----------------|---------|
| Discovery fails | SCOUT_RECON | Timeout | None | Escalate to BROOKS_ARCHITECT |
| Implementation fails | WOZ_BUILDER | Validation error | PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW | Retry with interface review |
| Refactor fails | FOWLER_REFACTOR_GATE | Debt detected | None | Escalate to BROOKS_ARCHITECT |
| Performance fails | BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF | No perf constraint | None | Skip (not applicable) |

## Conflict Resolution

When multiple routing approaches are possible, the Routing Policy Engine resolves conflicts using the following hierarchy:

### Conflict Hierarchy

1. **Performance evidence** — If performance history shows one agent has higher success rate, choose that agent
2. **Role constraints** — If performance evidence is inconclusive, choose agent with appropriate authority
3. **Architect decision** — If role constraints are ambiguous, BROOKS_ARCHITECT decides

### Conflict Scenarios

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Performance evidence inconclusive | BROOKS_ARCHITECT decides based on architecture |
| Architecture ambiguous | BROOKS_ARCHITECT decides based on principle |
| Destructive decision required | JOBS_INTENT_GATE must approve before routing |

---

## Performance-Based Routing

The Routing Policy Engine queries the Performance Log to make data-driven routing decisions.

### Metrics Used

| Metric | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Success Rate | `(AGENT_COMPLETED / AGENT_INVOKED) * 100` | 40% |
| Average Duration | `avg(created_at - start_time)` | 30% |
| Fallback Frequency | `FALLBACK_TRIGGERED / AGENT_INVOKED` | 20% |
| Blocker Frequency | `BLOCKER_HIT / AGENT_INVOKED` | 10% |

### Routing Score Calculation

```
function calculateRoutingScore(agentId, taskType):
    successRate = getSuccessRate(agentId, taskType)
    avgDuration = getAverageDuration(agentId, taskType)
    fallbackFreq = getFallbackFrequency(agentId, taskType)
    blockerFreq = getBlockerFrequency(agentId, taskType)
    
    score = (successRate * 0.4) + 
            (1 - normalize(avgDuration) * 0.3) + 
            (1 - fallbackFreq * 0.2) + 
            (1 - blockerFreq * 0.1)
    
    return score
```

### Routing Decision

```
function selectAgent(taskType):
    primaryAgent = routingTable[taskType].primaryAgent
    fallbackAgent = routingTable[taskType].fallbackAgent
    
    primaryScore = calculateRoutingScore(primaryAgent, taskType)
    
    if fallbackAgent is not None:
        fallbackScore = calculateRoutingScore(fallbackAgent, taskType)
        
        if fallbackScore > primaryScore * 1.2:  // 20% threshold
            log FALLBACK_TRIGGERED (reason="Performance-based routing")
            return fallbackAgent
    
    return primaryAgent
```

## Use Cases

### ROUTING-UC1: Discovery Task Routing

**Scenario:** Developer submits a task to discover repository structure.

**Steps:**
1. Developer submits task with `task_type=Discovery`
2. Routing Policy Engine queries Performance Log for SCOUT_RECON success rate
3. Routing Policy Engine calculates routing score
4. Routing Policy Engine selects SCOUT_RECON (primary agent)
5. SCOUT_RECON executes and logs `AGENT_INVOKED` + `AGENT_COMPLETED`

**Result:** Scout Report generated, task marked complete.

---

### ROUTING-UC2: Implementation Task with Fallback

**Scenario:** Developer submits a task to implement a new feature.

**Steps:**
1. Developer submits task with `task_type=Implementation`
2. Routing Policy Engine selects WOZ_BUILDER (primary agent)
3. WOZ_BUILDER executes and logs `AGENT_INVOKED`
4. WOZ_BUILDER adds new interface, logs `AGENT_FAILED` (validation error)
5. Routing Policy Engine checks fallback table
6. Routing Policy Engine selects PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW (fallback agent)
7. Routing Policy Engine logs `FALLBACK_TRIGGERED`
8. PIKE_INTERFACE_REVIEW executes and logs `AGENT_COMPLETED`

**Result:** Feature implemented with interface review, task marked complete.

---

### ROUTING-UC3: Architecture Task with Conflict

**Scenario:** Developer submits a task to design a new system component.

**Steps:**
1. Developer submits task with `task_type=Architecture`
2. Routing Policy Engine selects BROOKS_ARCHITECT (primary agent)
3. BROOKS_ARCHITECT logs `AGENT_INVOKED`
4. BROOKS_ARCHITECT encounters ambiguous architecture decision
5. BROOKS_ARCHITECT requests clarification from JOBS_INTENT_GATE
6. JOBS_INTENT_GATE provides clarification
7. BROOKS_ARCHITECT makes decision and logs `AGENT_COMPLETED`

**Result:** Architecture decision made, task marked complete.

| BELLARD_DIAGNOSTICS_PERF | Performance only | Read, run_in_terminal, get_terminal_output | Handoff to WOZ_BUILDER |

### Determinism Constraints

1. **MUST choose ONE best route** — No proposing multiple approaches
2. **MUST base decision on Performance Log** — No ad-hoc routing
3. **MUST log all routing decisions** — No silent routing changes

### Fallback Constraints

1. **MUST try fallback before escalating** — No skipping fallback
2. **MUST escalate to BROOKS_ARCHITECT if no fallback** — No silent failures
3. **MUST log `FALLBACK_TRIGGERED` on fallback** — No untracked fallbacks
