<!-- One or two sentences describing what this dictionary covers.
     Example: "This document describes every table and event in the [Service Name] data model.
     Each section includes field definitions, enum values, and links to the JSON Schema for that model." -->

**`[nested_object]` shape** — Schema: [[nested_object].schema.json](../json-schema/[nested_object].schema.json)

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|

| `[property]` | string | |

## [entity_c]

<!-- This entity is a runtime record produced during [operation]. It tracks … -->

| `id` | uuid | Yes | |

| `failed` | Completed with error (terminal) |
| `canceled` | Stopped by operator request (terminal) |
| `skipped` | Bypassed due to state condition (e.g., offline target) |

<!-- Copy this entity block pattern for every additional table/model in the system. -->

## [join_or_child_entity]

<!-- This table tracks per-[parent] instances of [entity_c]. One row per [entity] per [parent]. -->

Schema: [[join_entity].schema.json](../json-schema/[join_entity].schema.json)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | uuid | Yes | |

| `[holder]_id` | uuid | Yes | Foreign key → the record holding this lock |
| `acquired_at` | datetime | Yes | When the lock was created |

> **Note:** These records do not have `updated_at` — they are insert/delete only. There is at most one active lock per `[resource]_id` at any time (enforced by unique constraint).

## Events (Event-Driven Architecture)

<!-- If the service uses an event bus, document each event type here. Omit this section if not applicable. -->

### [event.domain.occurred]

**Producer:** <!-- Which component emits this event -->

| `[field]` | [type] | <!-- Additional payload field --> |

---

### [event.domain.state_changed]

**Producer:**  
**Consumer(s):**  
**Trigger:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|

<!-- === INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ===

1. Copy this file to DATA-DICTIONARY.md at the repository root.
2. Add one top-level section (##) per database table or entity in the system.
3. For every field in each JSON schema, add a row to that entity's field table.
4. For every enum field, add a sub-table listing each allowed value and its meaning.
5. For every foreign key, note the target table in the Description column.
6. Link each entity section to its corresponding `json-schema/*.schema.json` file.
7. If the service is event-driven, add one sub-section under "Events" per event type.
8. Keep field names, types, and enum values exactly in sync with the JSON schemas and code models.
9. Remove this instructions block before publishing.

=== CHECKLIST BEFORE MERGING ===
- [ ] One section per entity/table
- [ ] Every JSON schema field appears in the corresponding field table
- [ ] Every enum field has an enum value sub-table
- [ ] Every entity section links to its JSON schema file
- [ ] Field names match exactly between this document, JSON schemas, and code models
- [ ] All foreign key relationships are documented
- [ ] Event section is present (or explicitly marked N/A)
