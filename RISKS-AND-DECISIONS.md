## 1. Architectural Decisions

### AD-01: Deterministic Routing Policy

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | Decided |
| **Decision** | The Routing Policy Engine MUST choose ONE best route based on Performance Log history and role constraints. Multiple approaches MUST NOT be proposed unless performance evidence is inconclusive, architecture is ambiguous, or a destructive decision is required. |
| **Rationale** | Deterministic routing enables measurable performance, clear accountability, and continuous improvement. Ad-hoc routing leads to unpredictable behavior and unmeasurable outcomes. |
| **Alternatives considered** | **Ad-hoc routing:** Rejected because it's non-deterministic and unmeasurable. **ML-based routing:** Rejected because it requires training data that doesn't exist yet. |
| **Consequences** | Routing decisions are predictable and auditable. Performance metrics can drive improvement. However, the routing table must be maintained and tuned over time. |

### AD-02: Structured Event Schema

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | Decided |
| **Decision** | All performance events MUST be logged to Postgres with a structured schema: `event_type`, `group_id`, `agent_id`, `status`, `metadata`, `created_at`. |
| **Rationale** | Structured logging enables queryable metrics, audit trails, and continuous improvement. Unstructured logs are difficult to query and analyze. |
| **Alternatives considered** | **Unstructured logging:** Rejected because it's difficult to query and analyze. **File-based logging:** Rejected because it doesn't support real-time queries. |
| **Consequences** | Events are queryable and analyzable. However, the schema must be maintained and migrated over time. |
| **Owner** | BROOKS_ARCHITECT |

### AD-03: Documentation Compliance Gate

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | Decided |
| **Decision** | All agents MUST load AI-GUIDELINES.md as required context before execution. All agents MUST produce documentation artifacts following AI-GUIDELINES.md templates. The system MUST validate documentation completeness as part of DoD. |
| **Rationale** | Documentation compliance ensures consistency, quality, and alignment with established patterns. Without it, agents will create work that doesn't match project standards. |
| **Alternatives considered** | **Optional documentation:** Rejected because it leads to incomplete or inconsistent documentation. **Post-hoc documentation:** Rejected because it's often skipped or forgotten. |
| **Consequences** | Documentation is complete and consistent. However, it adds overhead to every task. |

### AD-04: MCP_DOCKER for Postgres Access

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | Decided |
| **Decision** | All Postgres operations MUST use MCP_DOCKER tools. Direct database access is prohibited. |
| **Rationale** | MCP_DOCKER tools provide a consistent, auditable interface for database operations. Direct access bypasses logging and audit trails. |
| **Alternatives considered** | **Direct Postgres access:** Rejected because it bypasses logging and audit trails. **ORM-based access:** Rejected because it adds complexity without clear benefit. |
| **Consequences** | Database operations are auditable and consistent. However, it requires MCP_DOCKER tool availability. |
| **Owner** | BROOKS_ARCHITECT |
| **References** | [DESIGN-LOGGING.md §Logging Contract](DESIGN-LOGGING.md#logging-contract) |

### AD-05: Two Execution Modes (DAY_BUILD and NIGHT_BUILD)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Status** | Decided |
| **Decision** | The harness MUST support two execution modes: DAY_BUILD (interactive with approval gates) and NIGHT_BUILD (no-brakes deterministic execution). |
| **Rationale** | DAY_BUILD mode allows operators to review and approve decisions. NIGHT_BUILD mode enables unattended execution for CI/CD pipelines. |
| **Alternatives considered** | **Single mode:** Rejected because it doesn't support both interactive and unattended use cases. **Three modes:** Rejected because it adds complexity without clear benefit. |
| **Consequences** | Operators can choose the appropriate mode for their use case. However, the harness must support both modes consistently. |

### RK-01: Agent Failure

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Status** | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Description** | An agent may fail during execution due to errors, timeouts, or validation failures. This can block task completion. |
| **Mitigation** | Fallback routing policy (AD-01) ensures that a fallback agent is invoked when the primary agent fails. If no fallback exists, the task is escalated to BROOKS_ARCHITECT. |

### RK-02: Performance Log Unavailability

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Severity** | High |
| **Likelihood** | Low |
| **Status** | 🔴 Open |
| **Description** | The Performance Log (Postgres) may become unavailable due to network issues, database failures, or MCP_DOCKER tool unavailability. This would prevent routing decisions and logging. |
| **Mitigation** | **Partial:** The harness can operate in degraded mode without performance history, but logging must succeed for auditability. **Open:** Need to define fallback behavior when Postgres is unavailable. |
| **Owner** | BROOKS_ARCHITECT |
| **Related decision** | [AD-02: Structured Event Schema](#ad-02-structured-event-schema), [AD-04: MCP_DOCKER for Postgres Access](#ad-04-mcp_docker-for-postgres-access) |

### RK-03: Routing Policy Drift

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Likelihood** | Medium |
| **Status** | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Description** | The routing policy may drift from optimal routing over time as agent performance changes. This can lead to suboptimal routing decisions. |
| **Mitigation** | Performance-based routing (AD-01) uses real-time metrics to adjust routing scores. The routing table is reviewed periodically by BROOKS_ARCHITECT. |

### RK-04: Documentation Incompleteness

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Severity** | Low |
| **Likelihood** | Low |
| **Status** | ✅ Mitigated |
| **Description** | Agents may produce incomplete documentation artifacts, leading to inconsistent or missing documentation. |
| **Mitigation** | Documentation compliance gate (AD-03) validates documentation completeness before task completion. Missing artifacts result in `TASK_FAILED`. |

### RK-05: Multi-Agent Coordination Overhead

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Likelihood** | High |
| **Status** | 🔴 Open |
| **Description** | Coordinating multiple specialized agents (SCOUT_RECON, JOBS_INTENT_GATE, BROOKS_ARCHITECT, WOZ_BUILDER, etc.) introduces overhead in terms of context switching, handoffs, and communication. |
| **Mitigation** | **Partial:** The execution order is defined in [BLUEPRINT.md §6](BLUEPRINT.md#6-execution-rules). **Open:** Need to measure and optimize coordination overhead. |
