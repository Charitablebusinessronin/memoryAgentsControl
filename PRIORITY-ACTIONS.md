## PRIORITY 1 — INTEGRATION BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Any GO)

| # | Action | Owner | Status | Estimated Effort |
|---|--------|-------|--------|------------------|
| 1.1 | Configure MCP client in OpenAgentsControl to connect to Allura's memory server | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 0.5 days |
| 1.2 | Add agent hooks: session-start calls `memory_search`, session-end calls `memory_add` | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 1 day |
| 1.3 | Update Brooks agent to call Allura tools before planning (via MCP_DOCKER) | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 1 day |
| 1.4 | Update Scout to use `memory_search` instead of direct PostgreSQL queries | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 0.5 days |
| 1.5 | Create `.env` pointing to Allura's DATABASE_URL and NEO4J_URI | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 0.5 days |
| 1.6 | Test end-to-end: Brooks → Allura → PostgreSQL/Neo4j | Brooks Architect | ✅ DONE | 1 day |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 4.5 days  
**Completed:** 4.5 days (6 of 6 tasks) ✅

**Integration Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

## Key Insight

**The Allura Memory System is already production-ready.** The OpenAgentsControl Harness just needs to connect to it. This is an **integration task**, not an implementation task.

**Reference:** [Allura Memory System](../../allura%20memory/README.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Configure MCP client to connect to Allura (PRIORITY 1.1)
2. **This Week:** Complete PRIORITY 1 integration blockers
3. **Before GO:** Test end-to-end integration
